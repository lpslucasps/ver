# For Stellaris 2.3.3

This mod expands how vassals work. It adds 12 new types of subject empires (1 for each ethics + 1 for hive minds +3 special types of subjects), each with its own perks. It also adds a new Policy, available once you finish the Domination tradition tree, that let you tax your subjects' trade, and a Proxy War mechanic.

## FEATURES

### New Types of Subject Empires

In vanilla, there are just two kinds of subject empires available to default countries: Vassals and Protectorates. It doesn't matter if you are a democratic crusader or a hegemonic imperialist, the way you treat your subjects is all the same.

In my opinion, to live under the yoke of an authoritarian-xenophobe empire should be different than to be subservient to an egalitarian-xenophile one. The funny thing is, this is exactly how it works with the Fallen Empires. Why, then, let the players do something similar? With that in mind, now each ethic has access to an exclusive type of subject empire. After you vassalize an empire, an event letting you transform the bland, generic vassals into custom ones is fired, as seen below.

Some overlord-subject relations are more predatory than others, others are quite benevolent. Not all types of subjects are advantageous, so think before you choose!

Corporations have Subject Types analogous to the ones of the Default Empires, but, in their case, what decides which subject types you have access to is your civics, not ethics.

Machine intelligences have their own set of subject types (two for now).

### New Policy: Taxation of Subject Empires

After you complete the Domination tradition tree, you can tax part of your subject empires Trade. There are 4 levels of taxation:

* No taxation: It's unfair to burden those that are not fully integrated into our society with duties they have not agreed on. *Our Subject Empires won't pay any additional taxes.*
* Light Taxes: Our subjects enjoy our protection and trade. A small contribution is the least we can ask for in return. *We'll tax up to 5% of our Subject Empire's collected Trade Value, slightly displeasing them.*
* Moderate Taxes: Every member of our empire, even those on its periphery, should contribute to its prosperity. *We'll tax up to 10% of our Subject Empire's collected Trade Value, displeasing them.*
* Heavy Taxes: The good of our citizens should be prioritized over any theoretical rights of our client states. *We'll tax up to 20% of our Subject Empire's collected Trade Value, greatly displeasing them.*
* Burdensome Taxes: A subject has no right other than to serve its master. *We'll tax up to 30% of our Subject Empire's collected Trade Value, leaving them enraged.*

Those policies are not available to nor affect Gestalt Consciousness empires.

*Note: Subjects' taxes cap at 10000 Trade Value.*

### New mechanic: Proxy War

If you have a Puppet State, you gain access to a new mechanic, called Proxy War. Through an edict, you can make a puppet attack a neighboring country. Valid targets must not be in an alliance with you (e.g.: federation) or be a Fallen Empire.

## LIMITATIONS AND KNOWN ISSUES

* Peacefully acquired vassals (diplo-vassalage, protectorates that become vassals, etc) will take up to a month to fire the event that transforms them into custom subject types.
* Some effects (lie the taxes from the "Taxation of Subject Empires" policy) may take up to a month to be applied/removed.
* The subject's taxes is not exact. The Trade Value "taxed" is added as a modifier to the capital, in 49 steps that go from 5 to 10000.

## FAQ

**Is this save-game compatible?**

It should be. Do note that any vassal acquired prior to the activation of this mod will take up to a month to be transformed into a custom subject empire.

**Is this compatible with [insert here]?**

No files were overwritten in the development of this mod, so it should be as compatible as it can be.

**What about the Feudal Society Civic?**

No changes for the Feudal Society Civic. My vision for this Civic would require a total overhaul that can't be done (or, at least, not easily) through modding alone.

**My vassals are useless!**

The AI is completely incompetent at everything. To compensante that, they receive a lot of bonuses to stay afloat. Unfortunately, these bonuses are deactivated from players' vassals. This behaviour is hard-coded. If you play on higher difficulties, vassals become a dead-weight. To solve this problem, I recommend using the mod Dynamic Difficulty. Among its many options, there's one to give player vassals the same bonuses as the AI.

**Will the AI use the new subject types?**

Yes! They will also, hopefully, make choices based on their own ethic, civics and personalities. So, for instance, Democratic Crusaders are much more likely to turn Vassals into Sister Republics.

**I made the wrong choice. How can I change my vassal into another type of subject again?**

Your choices are permanent, for the time being. I may add an edict or something like that in the future that let you change your subject empires' type again, but, or now, choose wisely!

**I vassalized someone but nothing happened!**

Please, wait at least a month for the "New subject empire" event to fire.

**What about protectorates?**

Protectorates already worked fine, giving a clear benefit (influence) and having special effects (reduced tech cost, becoming vassals eventually), so I didn't change them. When they become vassals, though, the event to turn them into a new type of subject empire will fire. Please, do note that the event my take up to an in-game month to show up!

**Why it seems like some of the text was written by a 5-years-old?**

English is not my native language (and I don't write that well in portuguese anyways). If you find any misspelling or even oddly-constructed/confusing sentences, let me know!

**I think I found a bug. Is this a bug?**

Maybe? This is the biggest mod I have ever made. If you think something's not working as it should, please, let me know!

**I have suggestions for new subject types/changes!**

That's not a question, but I'd love to hear it!
